     *     - global_merge_vars array global merge variables to use for all recipients. You can override these per recipient.
     *         - global_merge_vars[] struct a single global merge variable

Tags should be 50 characters or less.  Any tags starting with an underscore are reserved for internal use and will cause errors.
     *         - tags[] string a single tag - must not start with an underscore

     *     - recipient_metadata array Per-recipient metadata that will override the global values specified in the metadata parameter.
     *         - recipient_metadata[] struct metadata for a single recipient
     *             - rcpt string the email address of the recipient that the metadata is associated with
     *             - values array an associated array containing the recipient's unique metadata. If a key exists in both the per-recipient metadata and the global metadata, the per-recipient metadata will be used.

     *         - attachments[] struct a single supported attachment
     *             - type string the MIME type of the attachment - allowed types are text/*, image/*, and application/pdf

To handle rejections when sending in async mode, set up a webhook for the 'reject' event. Defaults to false for messages with no more than 10 recipients; messages with more than 10 recipients are always sent asynchronously, regardless of the value of async.
